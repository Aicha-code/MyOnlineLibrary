# MyOnlineLibrary
#this is a system that I will develop to simplify the management of my books
Welcome to my online library. I am building this system to be able to always know where to find these particular and specific books that I love and would like to read or even re-read because like many other people, I always see nice books online and take screenshots of them or even download them and I forget where they are and sometimes I even forget that I downloaded it. This system will help me and you have access to my favorite books and maybe also to yoursðŸ˜‰.

Reading is a crucial activity, especially in this time and age where we do everything AI, I want to still be among the ones who stay informed and are able to create things on their own.

##**Features**

âœ… Store and organize books in categories

##**Getting Started**

âœ…**Clone the Repository**
   Use the following command to download the project files:
  ` git clone https://github.com/Aicha-code/MyOnlineLibrary.git`

âœ…**Install Python**
   Make sure that Python 3 is installed on your system, check it by running:
   `python --version`
   
âœ…**Install Streamlit**
   If you don't have Streamlit installed, use pip to install it:
   `pip install streamlit`

âœ…**Ensure SQLite is Working**
   SQLite should be available by default in Python. You can test it by running:
   `import sqlite3`
