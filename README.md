# MyOnlineLibrary
this is a system that I will develop to simplify the management of my books
Welcome to my online library. I am building this system to be able to always know where to find these particular and specific books that I love and would like to read or even re-read because like many other people, I always see nice books online and take screenshots of them or even download them and I forget where they are and sometimes I even forget that I downloaded it. This system will help me and you have access to my favorite books and maybe also to yoursðŸ˜‰.

Reading is a crucial activity, especially in this time and age where we do everything AI, I want to still be among the ones who stay informed and are able to create things on their own.
